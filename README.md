# test SockSense Privacy Policy

Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Last Updated: [Insert Date]
SockSense (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use the SockSense mobile application (the “App”).
By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
1) Who We Are
Developer/Publisher: SockSense
Contact Email: support@caretoady.com
2) Information We Collect
A) Information You Provide Directly
We do not require account registration and we do not ask for:
names
phone numbers
email addresses
mailing addresses
usernames/passwords
payment card details
B) Gameplay and App Data
We may process gameplay and app-operation data such as:
game events (for example: stage starts/clears/fails, retries, results/share actions, battle pass actions)
app screen views
app version/build, locale, and session identifiers
app diagnostics and performance-related information
Some analytics event logs are stored locally on your device and can be exported by you from Settings.
C) Device, Usage, and Advertising Data
When ads are enabled, third-party ad/measurement services (such as Google AdMob) may collect or receive data such as:
device/app identifiers
usage and interaction signals
IP-based approximate location
ad performance and fraud-prevention signals
We do not request precise GPS location permission in the App.
D) Notifications
If you allow notifications, we may send local reminder notifications (for example, streak reminders or daily challenge reminders).
3) How We Use Information
We use information to:
provide and operate the App
save and restore local gameplay progress
improve gameplay balance, stability, and performance
provide rewarded, interstitial, and banner ad experiences
prevent abuse/fraud and maintain security
comply with legal obligations
4) Advertising, Tracking, and ATT
SockSense uses ad services including Google AdMob.
Where required, we request App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission before allowing tracking-based personalization. If you decline tracking, ads may still be shown, but personalization may be reduced.
You can change tracking permission anytime in iOS Settings:
Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.
5) Legal Bases (EU/UK GDPR)
If you are in the EU/UK, we rely on one or more lawful bases:
Consent (for example, tracking permission where required)
Performance of a Contract (providing core App functionality)
Legitimate Interests (security, diagnostics, service improvement)
Legal Obligation
Vital Interests (where applicable)
6) Sharing and Disclosure
We may disclose/share information with:
Google AdMob / Google LLC (advertising and related measurement)
Apple services used by the App ecosystem (for example, App Store, Game Center, notification infrastructure where applicable)
service providers that support app operation, security, or compliance
authorities where legally required
a successor entity in connection with merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets
Depending on your jurisdiction, some ad-related sharing may be considered “sharing” (and in some contexts “sale/share”) under privacy laws.
7) Data Retention
We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy.
Locally stored gameplay/analytics data remains on your device unless you remove it. You can delete local app data via:
Settings → Delete All Data.
8) Your Privacy Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or limit processing of personal information, and to opt out of certain sharing/targeted advertising activities.
To make a privacy request, contact: support@caretoady.com.
If available in your region, you may also opt out of tracking-based personalization via iOS tracking settings.
9) Children’s Privacy
SockSense is not directed to children under the age where parental consent is required by applicable law. If you believe a child provided personal information in violation of applicable law, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
10) Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
11) International Data Transfers
Your information may be processed in countries other than your own, including where service providers operate. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers.
12) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last Updated” date when changes are made. Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the revised policy.
